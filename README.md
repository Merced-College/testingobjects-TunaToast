Reflection & Turn-In

1.  Before "toString" the output would be on new lines with, in my case, Cat(memory addresses of data in the variables)
2.  The three fields would have "null" as a value without setting anything.
3.  With the default constructor, the name, age, and breed are set as a constant, whereas with the parameterized constructor you are able to change the values from the outside.
4.  Override tells Java that you want to replace the values of a method with the ones tagged with the @Override flag.
5.  Encapsulation is preferred over public fields in order to hide certain inner workings from the user.  One concrete validation rule would be to make it so that the user would need access to the private fields in order to change something.
